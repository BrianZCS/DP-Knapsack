# DP-Knapsack


The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.


The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each
instance, there will two positive integers, representing the number of items and the capacity, followed
by a list describing the items. For each item, there will be two nonnegative integers, representing the
weight and value, respectively

For each instance, your program should output the maximum possible value.
